        <h1>The Illuminate</h1>
        <h2>Governance</h2>
        <p>The Illuminate is the primary government controlling Avalon. They aren't evil so much as naive? Well intentioned, but the avali are relatively new to the intergalactic scene and even the best minds are far behind their alien rivals. The Avali Free Worlds get around this by living at peace with aliens, but the Illuminate is a xenophobic entity.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>As with any faction of avali, the population is divided into tribes. Each tribe specializes in some kind of work or trade.<br>When a pack of kits is old enough to set out on their own, they will go to find a tribe that suits their talents. This is often their home tribe, though it is not taboo to leave and find suitable work.<br>The tribes are not generally strictly controlled by the Illuminate directly; instead, the local leaders prove their competence through public works and production quotas. When necessary, the local population can replace a leader or ask the Illuminate for a replacement; usually the Illuminate does not have any reason to replace a leader before the locals realize something is wrong.</p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>Sync crystals are a highly classified material, of which the vast majority is quantumly entangled with the crystals harvested near it. They are found only in one location known to but a few Illuminate leaders and the workers who mine it out.<br>As the crystals are entangled and transmit changes in state instantly, they are commonly used in avalonian electronics where latency is a concern. The state of a crystal is known to be flipped by ███████████ and neural signals.</p>
        <p>Provided by an unknown and ancient benefactor, the Oracle is a supercomputer at the heart of Avalon. The Oracle offers and threatens singularity; its wisdom invaluable to the rapid spread of the avali throughout the local cluster.<br>Although not all avali are part of the Illuminate (only about half the population), the wisdom of the Oracle and the usefulness of the Nexus is respected across all factions.</p>
        <h1>Subfactions</h1>
        <h2>Oracle Cult</h2>
        <p>The Oracle is a supercomputer of ancient origin. While all avali, Illuminate or not, respect the knowledge of the Oracle and use the Nexus, the Oracle Cult take it a step further with augmentation. Most avali have a part of themselves (their feather patterns, their body, their head) that they would feel like they can't be the same if it got destroyed or replaced, but for a Cult member the only thing that identifies them is their memory. Without the fear of losing their identity to physical augmentation, Oracle Cult members often go as far as replacing everything but their minds to become a perfect entity.</p>
